\chapter{SCIENTIFIC THINKING AND KNOWLEDGE}\label{chap:02}

In recent decades, humans have begun to understand the underlying structure and characteristics of natural and human-made systems in a scientific way. Chapter One emphasized the human-modified world as primary evidence of the importance of drawing upon each system category.

Some system definitions and system science concepts are presented to provide a basis for the study of systems engineering and analysis. They include the definitions of system characteristics, a classification of systems into various types, consideration of the current state of systems science, and a discussion of the transition to the Systems Age. Finally, the chapter presents technology and the nature and role of engineering in the Systems Age and ends with an account of the development of systems thinking to date with extension beyond the world we know today.
