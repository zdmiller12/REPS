\chapter{ORGANIZING HUMAN ACTIVITY SYSTEMS}\label{chap:03}

Organization is human kind’s most important innovation1. It is a human made system that necessitates and requires cooperative action. The human-made world came into existence by and through cooperative collaboration; through purposeful action involving enterprises.

The fundamental unit of humanity is the individual. Each person spends a portion of their time coordinating their effort with that of others. They also spend some of their time in activity which is essentially independent of other individuals. While no activity is completely independent of the activity of all others over all time, in a more immediate sense activity can be considered independent if it does not require some direct coordination with one or more other people. An individual can read to himself or play golf alone. He may also spend the day driving a tractor on his farm.

Organizations consist of the coordinated efforts of individuals and have existed since the beginning of recorded history. Through cooperative action, people have been able to overcome their individual limitations. The high standard of living enjoyed by modern society may be attributed largely to the ability of organizations to change the physical environment more effectively than is possible through individual action alone. In this respect, organization is humankind’s most important innovation.
