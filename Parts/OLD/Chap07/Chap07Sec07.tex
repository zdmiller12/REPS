\section{Technical Performance Measures}\index{Technical Performance Measures}

As defined in, <emphasis>technical performance measures</emphasis> (TPMs) are quantitative values (estimated, predicted, and/or measured) that describe system performance. TPMs are measures of the attributes and/or characteristics that are inherent within the design. <emphasis>Design dependent parameters</emphasis> (DDPs) are quantified and are the bases for the determination of TPMs. During conceptual design, these values are best determined by parametric methods.
