Systems engineering and analysis reveals unexpected ways of using technology to bring new and improved systems and products into being that will be more competitive in the global economy. New and emerging technologies are expanding physically realizable design options and enhancing capabilities for developing more cost-effective systems. And, unprecedented improvement possibilities arise from the proper application of the concepts and principles of systems engineering to legacy systems.

This chapter introduces a technologically based interdisciplinary process encompassing an extension of engineering through all phases of the system life cycle; that is, design and development, production or construction, utilization and support, and phase-out and disposal. The process is derived from the concepts and general systems thinking presented in Part I of this textbook.

The final section of this chapter provides a summary and extension of the key concepts and ideas pertaining to the process of bringing systems into being. It is augmented with some annotated references and website addresses identifying opportunities for further inquiry. General references and website addresses supporting the ideas in this chapter are given in
