Various but basic principles of economics apply around the world and have applied over thousands of years of recorded history. They apply in many very different kinds of economies - capitalist, socialist, feudal, or whatever - and among a wide variety of peoples, cultures, and governments. 

We can begin understanding economics by first being clear as to what economics means. To know what economics is, we must first know what an economy is. Perhaps most of us think of an economy as a system for the production and distribution of the goods and services we use in everyday life. That is true as far as it goes, but it does not go far enough.

The Garden of Eden included a system for the production and distribution of goods and services, but it was not an economy, because everything was available in unlimited abundance. Without scarcity, there is no need to economize - and therefore no economics was yet extant.
